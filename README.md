# Go-connection-SQL
 
This code (connector.go) is to communicate between our mysql and our go code. We should import our deneme2.sql file into our mysql.
for connector.go
In order to run our 'connector.go' code, it must first be run together with 'go.mod' and 'go.sum' containing our modules. Those files are required for our module.
